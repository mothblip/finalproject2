Atelier Triay Font Licence

The fonts are the property of Atelier Triay Ltd ("we"). You are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable, licence to use them.

The trial licence can be used to make mockups, proofs, or similar but cannot be used on anything public facing, profitable or not. The free personal licence allows the aforementioned as well as use for non-profitable and non-commercial purposes. There should be no monetary benefit to any of the parties as a result of using the fonts with a personal licence. Otherwise, please get a commercial licence.

The single weight pro licence allows for use on 1 website (one domain with subdomains), 1 app, 1 e-book and unlimited printed or digital assets (logos, posters, ads, social media assets, etc.). The family licences allow for use on any number of the aforementioned. For series of physical goods (mugs, t-shirts, etc.) or use in broadcasting (TV, movies, etc.), please get in touch.

The personal and pro fonts can be modified for your needs, as long as it is for your own purpose only (please, send me a copy as well). Any derived versions remain my property. They are subject to the same licence and the copyright must remain intact. You cannot modify the trial fonts under any circumstances.

You can install the fonts on any device dedicated exclusively to you/your company. They can only be used for projects on your/your organisation’s behalf. You cannot use these fonts to promote hate speech. Your licence can be revoked at any time, at my sole discretion.

Do not distribute (this includes share, rent, lend, give away, and sell) original or modified versions of them. You can however embed read-only versions in files you create including PDFs, ebooks, websites and apps. These embedding rights don’t extend to websites and editable documents you create on behalf of third parties (for example as a freelance designer/developer). Third parties will need to get their own licence.

Purchases are non-refundable. For questions and support, email hello@readvisions.com (help cannot be guaranteed).

Note: the fonts are provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, including but not limited to the warranties of title, fitness, merchantability and non-infringement. There is no obligation to provide support or updates for the fonts, and we may not be held liable for any damages, claims or other liability arising from its use. We reserve all rights not otherwise specified and the terms of this licence can be changed without notice.
